# AIAgents
Agentic AI and AI Agent samples

# ADK - Agent Development Kit
* Flexible and modular framework for developing and deploying AI solutions 
* Can be used with LLMs and open source generative AI solutions
* Tightly integrated with google cloud ecosystem like Cloud Run & Gemini models - offering an efficient and fast way to orchestrate and scale multi-agent solutions

# MCP - Model Context Protocol
* MCP server is middleware platform facilitating communication and coordination between multiple software agents with external tools
* Provides a standardized, flexible and reliable messaging infrastructure, enabling diverse agents to exchange information, negotiate tasks and collaborate effectively.
* Simplifying agent interactions and enhancing overall system efficiency

# A2A - Agent to Agent Protocol
* Enables different AI agents to communicate and collaborate without sharing their internal workings
* Key principles of simplicity by reusing existing standards, enterprise readiness with built-in authentication and security features
* Protocol supports text, video/audio, forms and iframes while maintaining opaque execution where agents donâ€™t have to share their thoughts, plans or tools.
* Supports sequential, parallel and loop dynamics
* Uses HTTP for transport between clients and remote agents with JSON-RPC2.0 as the data exchange format, allowing agents to accomplish tasks while maintaining enterprise level security.
